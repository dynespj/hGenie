This Haskell library provides bindings for the PARI library. Its purpose is to experiment with using Haskell to perform fast number theory computations. It was inspired by Martin Raum's original HFlint library (https://github.com/martinra/hflint), which provides similar bindings for Flint, another popular C library for number theory computations. The author provides no guarantees that this library will have any advantages over the former. It is merely for experimentation.

Update: I will likely be restructering this project to work with libraries like Arb (https://arblib.org/), FLINT (https://www.flintlib.org/), Antic (https://github.com/wbhart/antic), and the like, similar to what has been done in Julia for the Nemo CAS (https://github.com/Nemocas/Nemo.jl). The explicit and overly rigid stack managment of the PARI system does not lend itself well to a functional programming paradigm, as it is difficult to know when objects will be deleted by the Haskell compiler, and the stack system of PARI is incredibly sensitive to non-contiguous garbage. The goal is to see is functional programming can lend any benefits to the world of extreme computation in number theory.
