This Haskell library provides bindings for the PARI library. It purpose is to experiment with using Haskell to perform fast number theory computations. It was inspired by Martin Raum's original HFlint library (https://github.com/martinra/hflint), which provides similar bindings for Flint, another popular C library for number theory computations. The author provides no guarantees that this library will have any advantages over the former. It is merely for experimentation.
